### Fission and Fusion in Big Atom Simulations

#### Overview

In our big atom simulation, we introduce fission and fusion processes to model complex nuclear physics interactions. These processes involve the splitting and merging of big atoms, resulting in changes to mass, velocity, and energy dynamics. We ensure that the principles of conservation of mass, energy, and momentum are maintained throughout these events. Additionally, the energy lost during fission and fusion is tracked and incorporated into the Energy Dissipation Potential (EDP), maintaining the overall energy balance of the system.

#### Fission Event

##### Conservation Principles

1. **Mass and Density**:
   - The resulting big atoms from a fission event should have the same density as the original big atom.
   - Density \(\rho\) is defined as:
     \[
     \rho = \frac{m}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3}
     \]
   - For the resulting big atoms with masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), their radii \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are:
     \[
     R_1 = \left( \frac{3 m_1}{4 \pi \rho} \right)^{1/3} \quad \text{and} \quad R_2 = \left( \frac{3 m_2}{4 \pi \rho} \right)^{1/3}
     \]

2. **Velocity**:
   - The initial velocities of the resulting big atoms are the same as the original big atom's velocity:
     \[
     \mathbf{v}_1 = \mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{v}_{\text{original}}
     \]

3. **Energy**:
   - The energy lost \(E_{\text{lost}}\) during fission is equal to the repulsion potential energy:
     \[
     E_{\text{lost}} = \frac{\gamma}{2} \left( R_1 + R_2 - \delta \right)^2
     \]

##### Fission Event Details

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - A big atom with mass \(m\) splits into two atoms with masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\).
   - The resulting masses satisfy \(m = m_1 + m_2 + E_{\text{lost}}\).

2. **Repulsion Force**:
   - The repulsion force between the two resulting big atoms ensures they separate quickly:
     \[
     \mathbf{F}_{\text{repulsion}} = -\gamma \frac{(R_1 + R_2 - \delta)}{\delta^3} (\mathbf{X}_1 - \mathbf{X}_2)
     \]

3. **Update EDP**:
   - Add the lost energy to the EDP:
     \[
     \text{EDP} = \text{EDP} + E_{\text{lost}}
     \]

#### Fusion Event

##### Conservation Principles

1. **Mass and Density**:
   - When two big atoms merge, the resulting big atom should have the same density as the original big atoms.
   - For two atoms with masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), and radii \(R_1\) and \(R_2\):
     \[
     \rho = \frac{m_1}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_1^3} = \frac{m_2}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_2^3}
     \]
   - The resulting big atom with mass \(m = m_1 + m_2 - E_{\text{lost}}\) has radius:
     \[
     R = \left( \frac{3 (m_1 + m_2 - E_{\text{lost}})}{4 \pi \rho} \right)^{1/3}
     \]

2. **Velocity**:
   - The resulting big atom's velocity should conserve momentum:
     \[
     \mathbf{v} = \frac{m_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{v}_2}{m_1 + m_2}
     \]

3. **Energy**:
   - The energy lost during fusion is added to the EDP, accounting for the repulsive energy that is no longer present:
     \[
     E_{\text{lost}} = \frac{\gamma}{2} \left( R_1 + R_2 - \delta \right)^2
     \]

##### Fusion Event Details

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Two big atoms with masses \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) and velocities \(\mathbf{v}_1\) and \(\mathbf{v}_2\) merge.
   - The resulting big atom has mass \(m = m_1 + m_2 - E_{\text{lost}}\).

2. **Remove Repulsion Force**:
   - Since the two atoms merge into one, the repulsion force between them is removed.

3. **Update EDP**:
   - Add the lost energy to the EDP:
     \[
     \text{EDP} = \text{EDP} + E_{\text{lost}}
     \]

### Detailed Equations

#### Fission Event

1. **Density and Radius Calculation**:
   \[
   \rho = \frac{m}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3}
   \]
   \[
   R_1 = \left( \frac{3 m_1}{4 \pi \rho} \right)^{1/3} \quad \text{and} \quad R_2 = \left( \frac{3 m_2}{4 \pi \rho} \right)^{1/3}
   \]

2. **Velocity**:
   \[
   \mathbf{v}_1 = \mathbf{v}_2 = \mathbf{v}_{\text{original}}
   \]

3. **Energy Lost**:
   \[
   E_{\text{lost}} = \frac{\gamma}{2} \left( R_1 + R_2 - \delta \right)^2
   \]

4. **Update EDP**:

   \text{EDP} = \text{EDP} + E_{\text{lost}}
   \]

5. **Repulsion Force**:
   \[

   \]

#### Fusion Event

1. **Density and Radius Calculation**:
   \[
   \rho = \frac{m_1}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_1^3} = \frac{m_2}{\frac{4}{3} \pi R_2^3}
   \]
   \[
   R = \left( \frac{3 (m_1 + m_2 - E_{\text{lost}})}{4 \pi \rho} \right)^{1/3}
   \]

2. **Velocity**:
   \[
   \mathbf{v} = \frac{m_1 \mathbf{v}_1 + m_2 \mathbf{v}_2}{m_1 + m_2}
   \]

3. **Energy Lost**:
   \[
   E_{\text{lost}} = \frac{\gamma}{2} \left( R_1 + R_2 - \delta \right)^2
   \]

4. **Update EDP**:
   \[
   \text{EDP} = \text{EDP} + E_{\text{lost}}
   \]

### Summary

By incorporating fission and fusion processes into the big atom simulation, we can model complex nuclear interactions while ensuring the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. The repulsion forces during fission and the removal of repulsion forces during fusion account for the energy dynamics, ensuring that the total energy remains conserved. The energy lost during these events is tracked and added to the Energy Dissipation Potential (EDP), maintaining a realistic and stable energy balance within the system. This approach provides a robust framework for simulating the dynamic behavior of big atoms and their interactions.
