Hull overlap
bounding volumes
maybe only composites should participate in repulsion forces
springs for big atoms can spontaneously form

may prevent interesting deformations from big atoms repulsing. perhaps big atoms use simpler calc for repulsion. more complex calc from composite repulsion

also consider impulse for sudden velocity
