### Design Document: Internal Temperature and Dynamic Interactions

#### Internal Temperature of Big Atoms and its Influence on Dynamics

This section details how the internal temperature of a big atom influences the dynamic interactions within the simulation. By modeling the Sun as a big atom, we demonstrate the computation of internal temperature, its impact on the potential energy field, and the resulting force field that affects the motion of other particles. This approach ensures realistic and engaging simulation dynamics.

#### Internal Temperature

The internal temperature of a big atom represents the kinetic energy of its internal components. This internal energy influences the potential energy field around the big atom, affecting nearby particles.

1. **Internal Kinetic Energy ($E_{\text{internal}}$)**:
   $$
   E_{\text{internal}} = k_B T_{\text{internal}}
   $$
   where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant and $T_{\text{internal}}$ is the internal temperature of the big atom.

#### Potential Energy Function

The internal temperature induces a potential energy field around the big atom. The potential energy ($U_T$) is given by:
$$
U_T = k_T T_{\text{internal}}
$$
where $k_T$ is a scaling factor that determines the strength of the potential field.

#### Force Field

The force field ($\vec{F}$) is derived from the negative gradient of the potential energy:
$$
\vec{F} = -\nabla U_T
$$
Assuming $U_T$ depends on the distance $r$ from the center of the big atom, we get:
$$
U_T(r) = \frac{k_T T_{\text{internal}}}{r}
$$
The force is then:
$$
\vec{F} = -\frac{dU_T}{dr} \hat{r} = -\frac{d}{dr} \left( \frac{k_T T_{\text{internal}}}{r} \right) \hat{r} = k_T T_{\text{internal}} \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$

#### Example: Modeling the Sun as a Big Atom

To illustrate the impact of internal temperature on dynamics, we model the Sun as a big atom. We compute the internal temperature, derive the potential energy function, compute the force field, and update the positions and velocities of nearby particles.

1. **Given Parameters**:
   - Mass of the particle ($m$) = 1 kg
   - Initial position of the particle ($\vec{p}$) = (1 AU, 0, 0) where 1 AU = $1.496 \times 10^{11}$ meters
   - Initial velocity of the particle ($\vec{v}$) = (0, 0, 0)
   - Internal temperature of the Sun ($T_{\text{internal}}$) = $1.57 \times 10^7$ K
   - Scaling factor for the potential energy ($k_T$) = $1 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K
   - Time step ($\Delta t$) = 1 second

2. **Computations**:
   - Compute the force on the particle due to the Sun's internal temperature.
   - Update the particle's position and velocity using the time step.

```python
import numpy as np

# Constants
k_B = 1.38e-23  # Boltzmann's constant in J/K
AU = 1.496e11  # 1 Astronomical Unit in meters
G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2

# Given parameters
m_particle = 1.0  # mass of the particle in kg
T_internal_sun = 1.57e7  # internal temperature of the Sun in K
k_T = 1e-23  # scaling factor in J/K
r_initial = AU  # initial distance from the Sun in meters
v_initial = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])  # initial velocity in m/s
p_initial = np.array([r_initial, 0.0, 0.0])  # initial position in meters
dt = 1.0  # time step in seconds

# Potential energy function
def potential_energy(T_internal, k_T, r):
    return k_T * T_internal / r

# Force field (gradient of potential energy)
def force_field(T_internal, k_T, r):
    F_magnitude = k_T * T_internal / r**2
    return F_magnitude * -np.array([1, 0, 0])  # Force vector direction

# Update position and velocity
def update_position_velocity(p, v, a, dt):
    v_new = v + a * dt
    p_new = p + v_new * dt
    return p_new, v_new

# Initial calculations
r = np.linalg.norm(p_initial)
U_T_initial = potential_energy(T_internal_sun, k_T, r)
F_initial = force_field(T_internal_sun, k_T, r)
a_initial = F_initial / m_particle

# Update position and velocity
p_new, v_new = update_position_velocity(p_initial, v_initial, a_initial, dt)

# Output results
print(f"Initial Position: {p_initial}")
print(f"Initial Velocity: {v_initial}")
print(f"Force on Particle: {F_initial}")
print(f"Acceleration of Particle: {a_initial}")
print(f"New Position after {dt} seconds: {p_new}")
print(f"New Velocity after {dt} seconds: {v_new}")
```

#### Conclusion

By modeling the internal temperature of the Sun as a big atom, we have demonstrated how internal energy influences the dynamics of the simulation. The internal temperature induces a potential energy field that affects nearby particles, and the resulting force field is used to update the positions and velocities of these particles. This approach ensures realistic and engaging simulation dynamics, providing a rich and interactive environment for players in the space sandbox simulation.
