You are correct. The temperature \( T_{\text{internal}} \) should also account for the radius \( R_j \) of the big atom, as the distribution of thermal energy within the volume of the big atom affects the temperature.

### Revised Section

#### Internal Temperature of Big Atoms and its Influence on Dynamics

This section details how the internal temperature of a big atom influences the dynamic interactions within the simulation. By modeling the Sun as a big atom, we demonstrate the computation of internal temperature, its impact on the potential energy field, and the resulting force field that affects the motion of other particles. This approach ensures realistic and engaging simulation dynamics.

#### Internal Energy as the Fundamental Quantity

We have decided to make internal energy (specifically, thermal energy) the fundamental quantity for big atoms. This approach takes into account that a big atom with a large internal energy but also a large radius \( R_j \) might have a lower temperature than a smaller big atom with the same internal energy.

1. **Thermal Energy ($E_{\text{thermal}}$)**:
   $$
   E_{\text{thermal}} = C_j \cdot T_{\text{internal}} \cdot V_j
   $$
   where \( C_j \) is the heat capacity per unit volume of the big atom, \( T_{\text{internal}} \) is the internal temperature of the big atom, and \( V_j \) is the volume of the big atom.

Since the volume \( V_j \) of a spherical big atom with radius \( R_j \) is:
$$
V_j = \frac{4}{3}\pi R_j^3
$$

The internal temperature can be expressed as:
$$
T_{\text{internal}} = \frac{E_{\text{thermal}}}{C_j \cdot V_j} = \frac{E_{\text{thermal}}}{C_j \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R_j^3}
$$

#### Heat Capacity and Temperature

Each big atom has a heat capacity per unit volume, \( C_j \), which determines how its temperature changes with a given amount of thermal energy. A higher heat capacity means the big atom's temperature will change less for a given change in thermal energy.

#### Potential Energy Function

The internal temperature induces a potential energy field around the big atom. The potential energy (\( U_T \)) is given by:
$$
U_T(r) = k_T \frac{T_{\text{internal}}}{r^3} \frac{R_i^2}{(R_j + r)^2}
$$
where \( k_T \) is a scaling factor that determines the strength of the potential field, \( r \) is the distance between the two big atoms, \( R_i \) is the radius of the influenced big atom, and \( R_j \) is the radius of the influencing big atom.

#### Force Field

The force field (\( \vec{F} \)) is derived from the negative gradient of the potential energy:
$$
\vec{F} = -\nabla U_T
$$
Assuming \( U_T \) depends on the distance \( r \) from the center of the big atom, we get:
$$
U_T(r) = k_T \frac{T_{\text{internal}}}{r^3} \frac{R_i^2}{(R_j + r)^2}
$$
Substituting \( T_{\text{internal}} = \frac{E_{\text{thermal}}}{C_j \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R_j^3} \):
$$
U_T(r) = k_T \frac{E_{\text{thermal}}}{C_j \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R_j^3 \cdot r^3} \frac{R_i^2}{(R_j + r)^2}
$$
The force is then:
$$
\vec{F} = -\frac{dU_T}{dr} \hat{r} = k_T \frac{E_{\text{thermal}}}{C_j \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R_j^3} \left( \frac{3 R_i^2}{r^4 (R_j + r)^2} - \frac{2 R_i^2}{r^3 (R_j + r)^3} \right) \hat{r}
$$

#### Pressure Calculation

The pressure \( P(r, E_{\text{thermal}}, R_j, R_i) \) on a big atom \( i \) with radius \( R_i \) at a distance \( r \) from another big atom \( j \) with radius \( R_j \) and thermal energy \( E_{\text{thermal}} \) is:
$$
P(r, E_{\text{thermal}}, R_j, R_i) = \frac{k_T \frac{E_{\text{thermal}}}{C_j \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R_j^3}}{2\pi} \left( \frac{3}{r^4 (R_j + r)^2} - \frac{2}{r^3 (R_j + r)^3} \right)
$$

#### Thermal Energy Dynamics

As a big atom radiates thermal energy through the induced potential, its thermal energy \( E_{\text{thermal}} \) will decrease over time. This decrease in thermal energy will, in turn, affect its internal temperature, based on its heat capacity \( C_j \):
$$
\Delta E_{\text{thermal}} = -P_{\text{radiated}} \cdot \Delta t
$$
$$
T_{\text{internal}} = \frac{E_{\text{thermal}}}{C_j \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi R_j^3}
$$

This approach aligns with the principle that thermal energy is the fundamental quantity, and it incorporates the concept of heat capacity to determine the temperature of a big atom. This method also takes into account the cooling effect as thermal energy is radiated through the induced potential energy function, ensuring a dynamic and realistic simulation.

### Conclusion

By modeling the internal thermal energy of the Sun as a big atom, we have demonstrated how internal energy influences the dynamics of the simulation. The internal thermal energy induces a potential energy field that affects nearby particles, and the resulting force field is used to update the positions and velocities of these particles. This approach ensures realistic and engaging simulation dynamics, providing a rich and interactive environment for players in the space sandbox simulation.
