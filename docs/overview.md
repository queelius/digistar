## Overview: Sandbox Space Simulation Game Design Document

### Motivation

The primary motivation for this project is to create a highly interactive and scalable sandbox space simulation game. This game will simulate a vast number of "big atoms" interacting through various interesting forces, both global (e.g., gravity, electric fields) and local (e.g., repulsions, collisions). By leveraging GPU acceleration and optimized data structures like octrees, we aim to achieve high performance and handle a large number of simultaneous players and AI bots efficiently.

### Purpose of the Game

The game aims to provide an immersive space simulation environment where players can explore, interact, and experiment with various physical phenomena. Key objectives include:

- Simulating a dynamic universe with realistic physics.
- Simulate interactions between "big atoms" based on fundamental forces and properties.
- Because the constituent elements are fairly simple, the game can scale to a large number of big atoms, hopefully on the order of 10s of millions, making it possible to simulate complex multi-star systems each with hundreds of planets and moons and thousands of asteroids and comets, each of which may have different properties, behaviors, and resources.
- Allowing players to manipulate and observe the behavior of "big atoms" under different interaction dynamics and forces.
- Supporting a large number of concurrent players and AI bots for a rich multiplayer experience.
- Provide a DSL for celestial mechanics, making it easy to reproduce known systems and to create new ones based on known physics.
- Enable novel physics that can support relativistic-like effects, black hole formation, warp channels, and other exotic phenomena, all based on fundamental properties of the big atoms and their interactions.

### Optimization Goals

To achieve the desired scale and performance, we will focus on several key optimizations:
- **GPU Acceleration**: Offload computationally intensive tasks to the GPU to leverage parallel processing capabilities. We will use CUDA, kernel fusion, memory coalescing, and other GPU optimization techniques to make this possible.
- **Efficient Data Structures**: Use octrees to manage spatial queries and force calculations efficiently. We will overload the octree to handle many different kinds of forces and interactions.
- **Batch Processing**: Handle batch bounding box queries in parallel on the GPU to satisfy multiple queries simultaneously from different players and AI bots.

### Core Features

#### Physics Simulation
- **Big Atoms**: Fundamental units of the simulation, each with properties such as position, velocity, mass, charge, radius, interaction vector, rotation, internal temperature, and magnetic moment.
- **Force Fields**: Includes forces based on potential energy fields, such as gravity, electric fields, magnetic fields, Lennard-Jones potentials, and so on. Many of these forces can be approximated with "cut-off" distances to reduce computational complexity, although it may not even be necessary given the spatial indexing.
- **Octree Structure**: Utilized for efficient spatial partitioning and force calculations.

#### Bounding Box Queries
- Efficiently handle multiple bounding box queries using batched processing on the GPU.
- Utilize octrees to quickly determine atoms within specified regions, supporting dynamic game scenarios and AI behaviors.

#### Networking
- **RESTful Interface**: Provide a lightweight and fast HTTP-based interface for managing game state and interactions.
- **Binary UDP Interface**: Handle high-throughput, low-latency communication for real-time multiplayer interactions, based on zeromq or similar libraries.
- **Local IPC**: For local IPC, we use shared memory facilities that bypass system calls for maximum performance. This is particularly useful for AI bots and other high-frequency communication, such as between the physics engine and the rendering engine. The simulation server does not actually perform rendering, so the GPU can be completely dedicated to the physics simulation. 

#### Scripting and AI
- **Python Integration**: Expose a rich API to the Python interpreter, allowing for flexible scripting and AI control.
- **AI Bots**: Implement a base class `Agent` and derived class `SubsumptionAgent` to facilitate the creation of reactive, intelligent bots. More sophisticated AI frameworks to follow.
- **Language Modles**: We are also curious about using open source small language models to generate text for the game, either for AI bots or for other purposes in the game.

### **Future Work**

- **Further Optimization**: Continuously profile and optimize GPU kernels and data structures.
- **Advanced AI**: Develop more sophisticated AI behaviors and decision-making processes.
- **Expanded Features**: Introduce new gameplay elements, force types, and interactive objects.
