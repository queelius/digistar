### Big-Picture Overview

**Objective**: Simulate large-scale, cloud-like, nebula-like, or fluid-like formations using discrete big atoms with very low mass, charge, and other properties.

### Key Concepts

1. **Big Atoms**: Represent the nebula with large-radius big atoms that have low mass, low charge, and low thermal radiation. These atoms are distributed sparsely but cover a large volume.

2. **Minimal Interactions**: Due to their low mass and other properties, these big atoms interact weakly with each other, ensuring they spread out and form diffuse structures.

3. **Cohesive Forces**: Use either:
   - **Non-Stiff Springs**: Connect neighboring big atoms with springs that provide gentle cohesion without causing stiff interactions.
   - **Morse Potential**: Apply a potential function to simulate bonding forces that maintain the structure's integrity while allowing flexibility.

4. **Force Calculations**:
   - Use the Barnes-Hut algorithm to efficiently calculate gravitational and other long-range forces.
   - Apply additional forces due to thermal radiation and other interactions based on the low properties of big atoms.

5. **Simulation Loop**:
   - **Initialization**: Set up initial positions, velocities, and connections (springs) for big atoms.
   - **Force Calculation**: Compute forces using Barnes-Hut for long-range interactions and directly calculate spring or potential forces.
   - **Update**: Update positions and velocities of big atoms based on computed forces, incorporating energy dissipation over time.
   - **Visualization**: Render the big atoms as amorphous, cloud-like structures to depict the nebula.

### Visualization

- **Amorphous Representation**: Use techniques like alpha blending, particle-based rendering, or volume rendering to visualize the diffuse, cloud-like nature of the big atoms, emphasizing their large radii and weak interactions.

### Summary

This approach uses discrete, low-mass big atoms to model fluid-like, cloud-like formations. By leveraging non-stiff springs or potential functions for cohesion and using efficient force calculation methods like Barnes-Hut, the simulation maintains a balance between structural integrity and fluid-like behavior, suitable for representing nebulae and similar large-scale formations.
