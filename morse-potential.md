### Morse Potential for Big Atoms in a Space Sandbox Simulation

In the context of our space sandbox simulation, the Morse potential is a powerful tool for modeling the interactions between large, complex entities we call "big atoms." These big atoms represent everything from individual particles to entire structures, and the Morse potential helps us accurately simulate the forces that govern their behavior and interactions.

### Motivation

The primary goals of the space sandbox simulation are:
1. **Realistic Interactions**: Ensure that the interactions between big atoms, whether they represent individual particles or large structures, are physically realistic.
2. **Versatility**: Provide a flexible framework that can handle a wide range of interactions, from gentle bonding to the violent forces encountered in battles or resource extraction.
3. **Player Engagement**: Allow players to manipulate and understand the forces at play, enabling them to build, battle, explore, and mine effectively within the simulation.

### Fundamental Properties of Big Atoms

Each big atom in our simulation is characterized by the following fundamental properties:
- **Mass (\(m\))**
- **Radius (\(r\))**
- **Position (\(\vec{p}\))**
- **Velocity (\(\vec{v}\))**
- **Interaction Vector (\(\vec{i}\))**: A vector representing the interaction characteristics of the big atom.

### Morse Potential Energy Function

The Morse potential energy function models the interaction between two big atoms based on their separation distance. The function is given by:

\[
V(r) = D_e \left(1 - e^{-a(r - r_e)}\right)^2 - D_e
\]

where:
- \( r \) is the distance between the centers of the two interacting big atoms.
- \( D_e \) is the depth of the potential well, representing the bond dissociation energy.
- \( r_e \) is the equilibrium bond distance, the distance at which the potential energy is minimized.
- \( a \) controls the width of the potential well, indicating the stiffness of the bond.

### Derivation of Morse Potential Parameters

To tailor the Morse potential to our simulation, we define \(r_e\), \(D_e\), and \(a\) based on the fundamental properties of the interacting big atoms:

1. **Equilibrium Bond Distance (\(r_e\))**:
   \[
   r_e = (r_1 + r_2) \cdot (1 + \text{cosine\_similarity}(\vec{i_1}, \vec{i_2}) \cdot k_r)
   \]
   where \(k_r\) is a scaling factor that adjusts the influence of the interaction vectors on the equilibrium distance.

2. **Depth of the Potential Well (\(D_e\))**:
   \[
   D_e = D_{e,\text{base}} \cdot (1 + \text{cosine\_similarity}(\vec{i_1}, \vec{i_2}) \cdot k_D)
   \]
   where \(D_{e,\text{base}}\) is a constant base value, and \(k_D\) is a scaling factor.

3. **Width of the Potential Well (\(a\))**:
   \[
   a = a_{\text{base}} \cdot (1 + \text{cosine\_similarity}(\vec{i_1}, \vec{i_2}) \cdot k_a)
   \]
   where \(a_{\text{base}}\) is a constant base value, and \(k_a\) is a scaling factor.

### Conservative Force Derived from the Morse Potential

To ensure energy conservation in our simulation, we derive the force field from the Morse potential by taking the negative gradient of the potential energy function:

\[
\vec{F}(r) = -\nabla V(r)
\]

Calculating the derivative:

\[
V(r) = D_e \left(1 - e^{-a(r - r_e)}\right)^2 - D_e
\]

\[
\frac{dV(r)}{dr} = D_e \cdot 2 \left(1 - e^{-a(r - r_e)}\right) \cdot \left(-a e^{-a(r - r_e)}\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{dV(r)}{dr} = -2a D_e \left(1 - e^{-a(r - r_e)}\right) e^{-a(r - r_e)}
\]

Thus, the force is:

\[
\vec{F}(r) = -\frac{dV(r)}{dr} = 2a D_e \left(1 - e^{-a(r - r_e)}\right) e^{-a(r - r_e)} \hat{r}
\]

where \(\hat{r}\) is the unit vector in the direction of \(r\).

### Application in the Space Sandbox Simulation

The Morse potential provides a realistic and flexible model for the interactions between big atoms in the space sandbox simulation. It captures both the attractive and repulsive forces, allowing for a wide range of scenarios:

1. **Building Structures**: Players can use the potential to understand how big atoms bond to form stable structures, from small modules to large space stations.
2. **Battling**: The potential helps simulate the forces involved in collisions and impacts during battles, giving a realistic feel to damage and destruction.
3. **Exploring and Mining**: By accurately modeling the forces between big atoms, players can predict and manipulate the interactions needed to extract resources from asteroids and planets.

### Summary

- **Morse Potential Energy Function**:
