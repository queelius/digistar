# Build Status

## Fixed Issues
✅ C++ compilation issues in simulation.h - Fixed default member initializers
✅ AsciiRenderer Config struct - Fixed default member initializers  
✅ Added FFTW3 dependency - Installed via apt
✅ Fixed backend factory to use correct interface
✅ Added missing SimulationStats fields
✅ Added integrator type to PhysicsConfig
✅ Fixed SparseGrid -> GridSpatialIndex references

## Remaining Build Issues

### 1. cpu_backend_openmp.cpp Issues
- Line 311-312: Using `config.contact_stiffness` but should be `physics_config.contact_stiffness`
- Line 447: References undefined `SparseGrid` type (should be GridSpatialIndex)
- Line 477-478: References undefined `UnionFind` type (for composite detection)

### 2. Missing Method Implementations
- `ParticlePool::clear_forces()` - Need to implement
- `GridSpatialIndex` methods - Need implementation
- Various pool allocation methods need completing

### 3. Backend Method Signatures
- `computeContacts` and similar methods need access to PhysicsConfig
- Either pass as parameter or store reference in backend

## Next Steps

1. **Quick Fix for Build**: Comment out problematic lines in cpu_backend_openmp.cpp
2. **Implement Pool Methods**: Add clear_forces() and other missing methods
3. **Implement GridSpatialIndex**: Basic grid-based spatial indexing
4. **Wire Up Physics**: Connect ParticleMesh and other algorithms

## Working Components
- Examples compile and run with SimpleBackend.h
- Basic backend infrastructure in place
- Pool-based memory layout defined
- Multi-resolution spatial index architecture defined

## Dependencies Required
- FFTW3 (installed)
- OpenMP (included with GCC)
- C++17 compiler (available)
